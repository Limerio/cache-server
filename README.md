# Cache Server

Hello everyone

## Why I do this project ?

I want to present you a project of cache server like [redis](https://redis.io) or [memcached](https://memcached.org) with more externals features (I will present you in more details after) for my personal knowledge to understand rust and this core functionality through multiply projects (or crates ðŸ‘€).
I have already make projects in rust like a [file hasher](https://github.com/Limerio/file-hash) (cli), a [webscraper](https://github.com/Limerio/webscraper) or a [currency converter](https://github.com/Limerio/currency-converter) (cli) but there are small rather than this project.
